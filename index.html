	<h3> About me</h3>

	<img src = "Jayce_Brew"/>
	<p> My name is Jayce. I served four years in the Air Force, during which I led a 20-person team responsible for performing maintenance and repairs on various maintenance support equipment. These efforts provided tactical support to F-15 Strike Eagle fighter jets, valued at $80 million. After my service, I transitioned into the trucking industry, where I have been working for the past three years, while simultaneously pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Health Informatics at <a href ="https://www.mercer.edu/" target = "_blank">Mercer University</a>. I have also obtained my Pharmacy Technician certification. I am now preparing to leave the trucking industry to embark on a career in healthcare, with aspirations of becoming a Physician Assistant.
